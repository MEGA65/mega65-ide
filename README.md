# Creating an IDE for the MEGA65

This is a fork of the xemu emulators by LGB, with the goal of turning the
MEGA65 emulator into a Retro-themed IDE targetted at the MEGA65 and its
related development tools, such as the mdb remote debugger, and hot-patch
utility.

This is a work only just beginning, and will likely progress slowly for the
time being, unless others join the effort.

Emulators running on Linux/Unix/Windows/OSX of various (mainly 8 bit) machines,
including the Commodore LCD and Commodore 65 (with some Mega65 hacks) as well.

Note: there is *nothing* too much common in these machines. The only reason
that I emulate these within a single project, that I can easily re-use some
of the components needed, that's all!

This file is only some place holder :) For some sane documentation, please **visit
